an experimental and theoretical investigation of second-order supersonicwing-body interference, for a non-lifting body with wings at incidence .pressure distributions on the wing of two wing-body combinations aremeasured experimentally at mach numbers 3 and 4 with the wing at variousincidences in the range 0degree to 10degree . the results are comparedwith theoretical results which include interference effects calculatedaccording to the second-order supersonic wing-body interference theorydue to landahl and beane /1/ . this theory, having been testedpreviously for non-lifting wing-body combinations, is thus tested also forwings at incidence . the agreement between theory and experiment isfound to vary with mach number and wing sweepback . for the higher machnumber and moderate sweepback the theory gives a good prediction ofpressure distribution, but for the most adverse condition of low machnumber and large sweepback the theory is found to overestimate theinterference effects . this is expected as the theory assumes thesweepback of the wings is small compared with that of the mach line . anempirical guide to the limit of application of the interference theoryis given . within this limit the agreement between theory and experimentis found to deteriorate only a little with increase of incidence, overthe range tested .
