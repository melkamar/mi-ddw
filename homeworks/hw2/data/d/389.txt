simple shear flow past a flat plate in a compressibleviscous fluid .by transformation of variables, the problem of a simple shear flow ofa compressible fluid over a flat plate is reduced to the correspondingproblem for an incompressible fluid .  the prandtl number of thecompressible fluid is assumed to be unity and its viscosity to be a linearfunction of temperature .
