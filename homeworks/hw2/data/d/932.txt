buckling of circular cones under axial compression .presented are the results of an experimentalinvestigation to determine the bucklingstrength of right circular cones under axialcompression .  correlation of these data ismade with existing theory and with previouslypublished experimental data on circularcylinders,. thus a recommended procedurefor predicting the buckling load of rightcircular cones under the foregoing loadingcondition is presented .
