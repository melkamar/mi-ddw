on full dispersed shock waves in carbon dioxide .it is pointed out that, for shock mach numbers between 1 andthat the adjustments in the energy in all the degrees of freedomproceed slowly and in parallel and occur over a distance largecompared with the mean free path .  theoretical velocity profilesfor such shock waves are given and found to be in excellentagreement with interferometric shock-tube observations .
