general characteristics of the flow through nozzlesat near critical speeds .the characteristics of the position and form ofthe transition surface through the critical velocityare computed for flow through flat and round nozzlesfrom subsonic to supersonic velocity .  correspondingconsiderations were carried out for the flow about profilesin the vicinity of sonic velocity .
