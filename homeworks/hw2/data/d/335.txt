the interaction between boundary layer and shock waves in transonicflow .experiments of transonic flow past a circular arc profile show that theshock-wave pattern and the pressure distribution are strongly dependentupon the state of the boundary layer . a change from laminar toturbulent boundary layer at a given mach number changes the flow patternconsiderably .shock waves can interact with the boundary layer in a manner similar toa reflection from a free jet boundary . these shock waves are notdistinctly discernible from pressure distribution measurements .
