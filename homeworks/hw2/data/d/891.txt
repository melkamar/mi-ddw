buckling of a finite length cylindrical shell undera circumferential band of pressure .this paper is concerned with buckling of a circular cylinder offinite length subjected to a symmetrical band of external pressure .both experimental and theoretical results are presented .  theexperimental data were obtained from tests of three thin-walledsteel cylinders subjected to external pressure by a pneumatictube encircling the test cylinder at mid-length .  the theory isbased on the principle of minimum potential energy, and therayleigh-ritz procedure is used to expand the displacementcomponents in trigonometric series .theoretical results are given in the form of graphs which showbuckling pressure as a function of the following ratios ..cylinder radius thicknesscylinder length radiuspressure bandwidth cylinder lengththeoretical results are in close agreement with existingsolutions to special cases in which (1) the pressure is applied over theentire lateral surface, and (2) the pressure is concentrated along acircumferential line .  the theoretical results are also inagreement with the test results .
