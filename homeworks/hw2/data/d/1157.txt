hypersonic shock tunnel .a hypersonic shock tunnel has been developed for obtaining fluidmechanic information at the high mach numbers and corresponding stagnationtemperatures encountered in flight by long range ballistic vehicles andsatellites . this report describes the hypersonic shock tunnel andpresents some of the results obtained in the driven tube and in the nozzlehelium is ignited in the driver to produce strong shock waves in air .a shock velocity in air as high as 55,000 fps with a calculatedequilibrium temperature of 16,000 k has been produced in the driven tube . theeffects of high stagnation temperatures upon the detached shock waveand the pressure distribution for blunt bodies have been observed in thenozzle test section . the detachment distance devreased greatly at hightemperatures . the pressure distribution for the hemisphere was foundto be less than that predicted by the modified newtonian theory . shockwave boundary layer interaction at the leading edge of a flat plate wasobserved, and the results agreed with the analytical prediction . adetached shock wave was observed for a blunt two-dimensional body at verylow densities in the test section with a flow mach number of 19.6 .
