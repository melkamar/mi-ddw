heat transfer in planetary atmospheres at super-satellite speeds .the main purpose of this investigation is to examine the dependence ofheat transfer in planetary atmospheres on the total enthalpy up toflight velocities of 50,000 ft/sec where a large proportion of the atomsare ionized . the /total thermodynamic and transport property/ conceptdiscussed by hirshfelder /j.chem.phys.,26/2/,feb.,1957/ is used .
