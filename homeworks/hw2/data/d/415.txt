the aerodynamic design of section shapes for swept wings .an extension of work of lock and rogers and the result of cooperation byn.p.l., r.a.e. and members of the british aircraft industry to achieve asatisfactory design for an aircraft cruising at low supersonic speeds .knowledge of shock-wave prediction, onset of wave drag andshock-induced separation allows the basic design to be generalized for a widerange of parameters . unpublished work by bagley on the relation ofaerodynamic coefficients and geometry is used . the role of uppersurface velocity distribution is noted and methods for predicting pressuredistributions with shock waves are reviewed for both subsonic andtransonic flows .
