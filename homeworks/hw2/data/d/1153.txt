a study of the simulation of flow with free stream mach number 1 in achoked wind tunnel .the degree to which experimental results obtained under chokingconditions in a wind tunnel with solid walls simulate those associated withan unbounded flow with free-stream mach number 1 is investigated for thecases of two-dimensional and axisymmetric flows . it is found that aclose resemblance does indeed exist in the vicinity of the body, andthat the results obtained in this way are generally at least as accurateas those obtained in a transonic wind tunnel with partly open testsection . some of the results indicate, however, that substantialinterference effects, particularly those of the wave reflection type, maybe encountered under certain conditions, both in choked wind tunnels andin transonic wind tunnels, and that the reduction of these interferenceeffects to acceptable limits may require the use of models of unusuallysmall size .
