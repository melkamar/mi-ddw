effects of a flexible boundary on hydrodynamic stability .purpose of paper is to examine theoretically the use of coatings ofelastic materials to prevent transition from laminar to turbulent flow .theory is extension to flexible boundary of the small-disturbancetollmien-schlichting stability theory and makes use of /tietjensfunction/ and other functions that occur in solution of orr-sommerfeldequation . it is shown how solutions for flexible wall can be obtainedfrom solutions for rigid boundary .outline and discussion is given first for tollmien-schlichting stabilitytheory for rigid wall, then for theory for flexible boundary . theoryis given both for a nondissipative and a dissipative flexible boundary .behavior of flexible medium itself is also examined .practical requirements are discussed . for example, a conclusion is thatto avoid tollmien-schlichting instability, the wave velocity of surfacewaves in absence of flow should coincide with tollmien-schlichting wavevelocity at wavelength of /most dangerous/ tollmien-schlichting waves .moreover, damping should be large enough to prevent surface waves fromdeveloping but not so large that tollmien-schlichting waves arepermissable . author states that a boundary that is both soft and light,one whose elastic constants are of same order as the dynamic pressure ofthe flow, may be practical for use at high speeds . this surface shouldhave a small damping to avoid tollmien-schlichting type of instabilityand a large enough wave speed without flow to avoid surface waveinstability . although paper is somewhat sketchy in places, it givescomprehensive coverage of stability of laminar flow over a flexible wall .
