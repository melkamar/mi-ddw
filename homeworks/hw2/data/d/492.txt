prediction of ogive-forebody pressures at angles of attack .various approximations are being suggested for obtaining surfacepressures on arbitrary bodies at angle of attack .  this not presentsa method for obtaining an approximate pressure distribution overthe lower surface of an ogive forebody at angle of attack by utilizingthe calculated pressures for zero angle of attack .
