study of the oscillatory motion of manned vehiclesentering the earth's atmosphere .an analysis is made of the oscillatorymotion of vehicles whichtraverse arbitrarily prescribed trajectoriesthrough the atmosphere .expressions for the oscillatory motionare derived as continuous functionsof the properties of the trajectory .results are applied to a study ofthe oscillatory behavior of re-entryvehicles which have decelerations thatremain within limits of humantolerance .  it is found that a deficiency ofaerodynamic damping for suchvehicles may have more serious consequencesthan it does for comparableballistic missiles .
