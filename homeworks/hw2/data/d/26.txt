inviscid leading-edge effect in hypersonic flow .current interest in the problem of inviscid-viscousinteraction has led to the realization of the significant effect ofthe leading-edge thickness in hypersonic flow .  the purposeof this note is to give an account of the downstream influenceof the blunt leading edge on the basis of the hypersonic smallperturbation theory .
